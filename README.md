# AI Scene-Adaptive Image Generator

This project transforms a single portrait image into a scene-adaptive,
photorealistic image using pretrained AI models.

The system automatically:
- Segments the person from the input image
- Selects a target environment (studio, beach, mountain)
- Composites the subject into the new scene
- Generates a clean output image

> ⚠️ This project uses only pretrained models and does not train any model from scratch.
